# hints:

0. When Player hits shake btn, think abt if you should generate one last random handshake or the user can see the handshake and qickly select the matching one then hit shake without the shake btn changes the last handshake, so then the player wins, maybe do it for the quick screen only

1. when the user opens the app always start a game, (like openning the quick game round scree, but you first tell them ex: (the rock is knocking on your door, wanna open for him or lose some frienship with him, he gets angry fast (right add angry or friendly speed to the person class)))
2. Add Redux And Refactor, Add async storage and redux persist, read about them,
3. dont forget for asyncstorage but maybe in different way where you put a wrapper, and add get and set methods (AddNew,Update,Delete)
4. add the image animation to model maybe, add handshake animations and transfom rotation, etc....
5. Dont forget to add the extra,advanced stuff like character phrases, friend how much bars, and links and occurences of the handshakes,
6. Add the walkthrough to storage so it stop appearing every time we open the app
7. For you later, dont forget to add to your resume this project, and list stuff that you learned and applied, like mvc in react native frontend, and libraries wrapppers, model and object oriented javascript, esh alsalfah you applied translation and async storage
